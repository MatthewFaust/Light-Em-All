This Java code implements a word-based typing game using a functional programming approach and linked lists to manage words. It features interfaces and classes for handling word lists and individual words, including active and inactive states. The `ZTypeWorld` class extends `World` from the javalib library to manage game state, user input, and rendering. It supports game mechanics such as word updating, scoring, and level progression. Key functionalities include drawing the game scene, updating word positions, and responding to user interactions like typing and restarting the game.
